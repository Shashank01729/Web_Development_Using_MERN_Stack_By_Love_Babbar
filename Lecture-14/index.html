                A pixel is the smallest unit that constructs a digital image or graphic. 
                Pixels are combined to form a complete image, video, text, or any visible thing on a computer display. 
                Pixels are also a unit of measurement commonly used in graphic and web design, abbreviated as "px". 
                One pixel is equivalent to roughly 1‚ÅÑ96 inch (0.26 mm). This measurement is used to make sure a given 
                element will display as the same size no matter what screen resolution views it

                HSL : Hue, Saturation and Lightness

                Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 (or 360) is red, 120 is green, 240 is blue.

                Saturation can be described as the intensity of a color. It is a percentage value from 0% to 100%.
                100% is full color, no shades of gray.
                50% is 50% gray, but you can still see the color.
                0% is completely gray; you can no longer see the color.

                The lightness of a color can be described as how much light you want to give the color, 
                where 0% means no light (dark), 50% means 50% light (neither dark nor light), and 100% means full light.


                HSLA (alpha)

                HSLA color values are an extension of HSL color values, with an Alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.
                An HSLA color value is specified with:
                hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)
                The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all):
