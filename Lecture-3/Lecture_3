How Internet Works?

Inter Net => Interconnected Networks (Global System, interconnected n/w of billions of devices, computer, etc)

History:

1960s -----> ARPANET (DOD, Department of Defence)

 __________                               __________
|          |    Small Chunks (Packets)   |          |

   Source                                 Destination

1970 -----> ARPANET continued to expand and TCP was developed
1980 -----> TCP/IP and DNS
1990 -----> WWW
2000 -----> BroadBand and Media (FB)
Today -----> Ubiquitous Connectivity and Advanced Technologies (5G, IoT, cloud computing, etc)

To send msg to a destination machine we need ip adddress of that particular machine

ISP -----> Internet Service Provider -----> We access internet through ISP

Not Directly



PROTOCOL STACK: 

SRC ----------> DEST (If sending, let suppose 10 MB packet, then send it in small chuncks/packets)

    USER A                                      USER B

Protocol: Set of rules
TCP: Specifies prot number
IP: Add ip address in the request of the destination machine
In hardware, communication can be wired or wireless 


PACKET TRAVEL:

                    Client wants to send a request  
                                  |
                             Goes to ISP  
                                  |
Checks if it knows the ip address of the server where the request is to be forwarded 
                                  |
                        Goes to Server (If valid)

There can be many routers between client and server


There are many ISP
Browser -----> Request -----> Local ISP -----> Regional ISP -----> National Service Provider 

Router have a special data, called routing table
When request reaches router, if it knows the path then it will route the request, if no entry found, then it shows default behaviour -----> provide request to its parent router and then checks in its routing table for the entry and so on...


PROTOCOLS -----> HTTP
          -----> FTP
          -----> SMTP, etc

OSI MODEL
TCP IP MODEL

/* Homework */ 

Switch: A switch is a network device that operates at the data link layer(Layer 2) of the OSI model. 
        It connects devices within a local area network(LAN) and uses MAC addresses to forward data to the correct destination
 
Hub: A hub is a basic networking device that operates at the physical layer(Layer 1) of the OSI model. 
     It is a simple device that connects multiple devices in a network, but it doesn't have the intelligence to forward data selectively based on MAC addresses like a switch

Router: A router is a network device that operates at the network layer(Layer 3) of the OSI model. 
        It connects different networks and uses IP addresses to forward data between them

Modem: A modem(modulator-demodulator) is a device that modulates and demodulates signals to enable 
       digital data to be transmitted over analog communication channels. It is commonly used to connect a computer or router to the internet over a telephone or cable line


The Command by which i can print the ip address of www.google.com server, if yes then how will you do it, if not then why can't we do it?

Command: ping www.google.com


IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) -----> It is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol, using 32-bit addresses and widely deployed, but facing exhaustion of available addresses

IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) -----> It is the latest version, using 128-bit addresses to accommodate a vast number of unique addresses and overcome the limitations of IPv4
